    "description":"The *Shahnameh* or ‘The Book of Kings’ is a long epic poem, written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi. It is the national epic of Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan and consists of over 50,000 couplets. This literary masterpiece tells the mostly mythical, sometimes historical, past of the Persian Empire. The work is of central importance to Zoroastrianism and Persian culture and language. The heroes of the *Shahnameh* are the kings of the Kayanians, a legendary dynasty of Persian tradition and folklore. They also feature as the heroes of the *Avesta*, the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism. The map above illustrates the vastness and reach of the Kayanian dynasty.<br />The *Shahnameh* garnered a vast reach in its own right and has been considered a literary masterpiece. It might be imagined that curricula of western civilization were informed by Eurocentric assumptions and would not readily have found room for Ferdowsi on their shelves. Yet, when Sir John Lubbock proposed his list of The Best Hundred Books in 1886, the *Shahnameh* was already there. In general, such works are thought of as exemplary of something – of the national genius, or of the genre they represent – and likely reward lifelong attention because they grapple in a complex, transcultural and engaging manner with timeless, big-picture questions relevant to the human condition. Through the years, various critics have had resoundingly clashing opinions of the *Shahnameh* and its place in world history."},

    "description":"The main subject of this section of the *Shahnameh* is Gurgin, one of Kayka’us[^1], and subsequently one of Kai Khusrau’s[^2] champions. Gurgin incites Bizhan[^3] to enter Afrasiyab’s[^4] harem where Bizhan falls in love with Afrasiyab’s daughter, as illustrated in the picture above. Enraged by the relationship, Afrasiyab imprisons Bizhan in a deep well. When Kai Khusrau hears of Gurgin’s treachery, he imprisons him as well. <br  /> Gurgin hears about Rustam’s legendary exploits and believes that he could be the path to his freedom. Rustam was Iran’s national champion and greatest folk hero, and was known for his extraordinary strength, bravery, and loyalty. Gurgin writes to Rustam, praising him greatly and begging him to help him find favour with the Shah. He tells Gurgin how he would have nothing left if the Shah does not forgive him and how he wants to win his “unstained honour back.” <br  /> The significance of Rustam lies in his character’s transformation and subsequent sustained relevance over the years. Although he is a pre-Islamic hero, Rustam and his tasks are changed in the *Asadi Shahnameh* to fit the ideological purposes of the poet’s time and place. A century after his conception as a legendary hero of Iranian mythology, under the influence of the state religion of the Safavid Dynasty (1501-1736), Iranian pre-Islamic values underwent the process of Shi’itization. In *Asadi Shahnameh*, Rustam is both a national hero and a Shi’ite missionary. *Asadi* unites seemingly rival subjects like Islam with Zoroastrianism, philosophy with religion, and heroism with mysticism. <br  /> [^1]: 2nd king of the Kayanian dynasty <br  /> [^2]: 3rd king of the Kayanian dynasty <br  /> [^3]: the son of Giv <br  /> [^4]: the mythical king and hero of Turan, and the main antagonist of the *Shahnameh*"},

    "description":"Rustam is not happy to receive this message and is not inclined to help Gurgin. Yet, he takes Gurgin’s situation into consideration and sees how desperate he is and decides to help him. He says that maybe if Bizhan was freed from bondage, Gurgin’s life can be saved from Giv’s revenge. But Rustam knows that if fails on his quest, Giv will exact his revenge on Gurgin for his son.\n\n Gurgin is essentially stripped down, with his hands tied to his neck and his feet fettered to a plank at the bottom of a gloomy pit. He is metaphorically and literally separated from the outside world by the blocks of text above the illustration of him.\n\nAn alternate illustration, pictured above, shows Gurgin still stripped down and with his hands tied to his neck, but his feet have been allowed freedom. In Warner’s translation, Gurgin is described as confined in “gloomy pit and chain.” It has been noted that an analysis of the relationship of the literary text to the accompanying illustration in the *Shahnameh* reveals that text and image often compete with each other, rather than form a composite whole. Painters of the Shahnameh, centuries later, were generally concerned with the look of the story. In the process of illustrating it, they often added details not found in the text, deleted others found in it, and changed those they retained. Furthermore, the scenes they chose to illustrate were not always the ones that Ferdowsi himself dramatically emphasized in his epic. Different illustrators also illustrated the same scene differently as shown above."},

    "description":"The day after next, Rustam goes to Kai Khusrau’s court to ask him for a boon for Gurgin due to his “fallen fortune, and wretched plight.” The Shah replies that he swore Gurgin would remain imprisoned until Bizhan was freed. To this, Rustam says that whatever wrongs Gurgin has committed, he has paid for already. Gurgin was willing to offer his life because if the Shah didn’t forgive him, \"he will be outcast from the Faith and honour.\" Rustam also reminds the Shah of Gurgin’s exploits (pictured above), how he had taken part in every fight, and been a hero. The Shah, seeing how intent Rustam was and now wanting him to have plead in vain, decides to release Gurgin from his \"gloomy pit and chain.\""},
